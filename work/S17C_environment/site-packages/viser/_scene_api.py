        Like all cameras in the viser Python API, frustums follow the OpenCV [+Z forward,
        +X right, +Y down] convention. fov is vertical in radians; aspect is width over height.

        .. note::

            fov: Field of view of the camera (in radians).
            aspect: Aspect ratio of the camera (width over height).
            scale: Scale factor for the size of the frustum. A single float
                for uniform scaling or a tuple of (x, y, z) for per-axis scaling.
            thickness: Thickness of the frustum lines, in the units chosen via
                ``thickness_units``. Defaults to `0.02` world units.
            thickness_units: Units for ``thickness``. `"world"` (default)
                keeps the lines a fixed thickness in scene units, so they get
                thinner with distance like real geometry. `"screen"` keeps a
                fixed pixel thickness regardless of distance. The deprecated
                ``line_width`` argument maps to screen-space pixels, matching
                its old behavior exactly.
            color: Color of the frustum as an RGB tuple.
            image: Optional image to be displayed on the frustum.
            format: Format to transport and display the image using. 'auto' will use PNG for RGBA images and JPEG for RGB.
            jpeg_quality: Quality of the jpeg image (if jpeg format is used).
            wxyz: Quaternion rotation to parent frame from local frame (R_pl).
            position: Translation to parent frame from local frame (t_pl).
            visible: Whether or not this scene node is initially visible.
            cast_shadow: Whether this frustum should cast shadows.
            receive_shadow: Whether this frustum should receive shadows. If True,
                receives shadows normally. If False, no shadows. If a float
                (0-1), shadows are rendered with a fixed opacity regardless of
